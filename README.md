### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github! My personal website is currently being built, so I'm using Github as a replacement for now.

A little bit about me:
- I'm an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Business Administration with a minor in Data Science
- I'm the President of Web Development at Berkeley, UC Berkeley's premier web development education and development organization
- I'm the President and Founder of Cloud at Cal, UC Berkeley's first cloud consulting organization
- I'm extremely interested in Quantum Computing and Cloud technologies, and am a part of Quantum Computing at Berkeley
- I'm a huge fan of finance and specifically quantitive finance, which is a field I very much want to get into and learn more about

Some more:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on taking 3.5 CS classes and 3.5 Business classes without blowing up
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Algorithmic Trading, Blockchain, and Quantum Computing
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a formal mathematical paper explaining how division by zero is equal to infinity
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding options theory
- 💬 Ask me about physics, I can go on for hours about black holes and time dilation
- 📫 How to reach me: sgoel9@berkeley.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love men's gymnastics and used to be a gymnast myself!
